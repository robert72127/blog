    * Lexer and parser in ocamllex and menhir.
    * Bidirectional typechecker.
    * Codegenerator translating AST into intermediate low level language.
    * Register allocation algorithm that allow languange to be executed on real architecture with finite amount of registers.
    * Live variable analysis optimalization.

#### Raft Consensus Algorithm 
    * Distributed consensus algorithm written in GO
    * Replicated state machine.
    * Leader election.
    * Log replication.

#### Deep learning framework
    * Cpu only deep learning framework using numpy as backend.
    * Autograd on N-dimensional Matrices.
